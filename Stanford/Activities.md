Transcriptic is building a revolutionary laboratory virtualization platform: cloud computing for life sciences. Scientists submit protocols and they are executed using Transcripticâ€™s robots. When the protocol is done executing, results are sent to the person who submitted the protocol.  During the time I was there not everything was automated, so 2 biologists and I were doing cloning and genotyping experiments. I also learned some machine learning while I was at transcriptic, mostly focused on Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

I really enjoyed my time at Transcriptic, especially how fast moving things were. Unlike academia, where I could not see the effect of what we were doing until much later, if at all; at transcriptic I could see the result of what we were doing day to day. Another thing I liked is that I never knew what the day would be like; there are no dull days at startups.
