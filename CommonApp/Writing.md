The essay demonstrates your ability to write clearly and concisely on a selected topic and helps you distinguish yourself in your own voice. What do you want the readers of your application to know about you apart from courses, grades, and test scores? Choose the option that best helps you answer that question and write an essay of no more than 650 words, using the prompt to inspire and structure your response. Remember: 650 words is your limit, not your goal. Use the full range if you need it, but don't feel obligated to do so. (The application won't accept a response shorter than 250 words.)
Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
Please write an essay (250-650 words) on the topic selected. You can type directly into the box, or you can paste text from another source.

Since I was 13 I’ve spent most of my time reading papers and teaching myself biology. At first papers were full of jargon I couldn’t make sense of, and reading a single paper could take me days; I had to slowly Google every concept I didn’t understand, and then Google all the concepts that I didn’t understand from the previous concept’s explanation.  But then the jargon started to make sense. I decided it was time for me to take the next step: start working at a lab. 

I cold emailed at least 500 professors and met with a fair amount of them. Meting with professors, discussing research and touring labs was exhilarating. Having grown up in Guatemala, where there aren’t any research labs, I was unsure what to expect. I’d dreamed of a place full of pristine benches, manned by intimidating figures wearing white lab coats and gloves; what I saw was a ton of flasks and vials crammed on shelves and benches, and occasionally in use by ordinary-looking people hurdled over microscopes or using pipettes. 

From the first time I was at a lab I knew that was how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Doing experiments, contributing pieces to the universe of scientific knowledge rather than passively reading about the newest discoveries. I didn’t know it then, but I wasn’t far from really starting my journey as a scientist. 

After meeting with several scientists, I decided I wanted to work on the MS microbiome at the Baranzini lab. Immediately after meeting with the PI I emailed him and said that I didn’t care what it took, if I had to clean petri plates or sweep the floor, but I wanted to join his lab. To my surprise, Sergio allowed my twerpy 14 year old self to start working at his lab; so I moved from Guatemala to San Francisco, by myself, and joined the lab. 

Every day I would walk 1.5h to get to the train station, took the train for one hour up to San Francisco, walked an additional 15 min and got to the lab around 8 am. I left the lab the latest I was allowed to, having spent the entire night there a couple of times; and then took the entire trip back home, usually arriving around 11pm. 

Being at the lab was one of the most amazing experiences. It was my own scientific paradise, where everything seemed possible, where I could turn the hint of an idea into an experiment. About 8 months in I decided I wanted to try something else, and I started working at a startup called Transcriptic.

Transcriptic is like Amazon Web Services for science. You submit a protocol and it is executed using Transcriptic’s robots, then the results are sent to you. Being at Transcriptic was an entirely new adventure. I still got to do science, but everything was faster moving than life in academia. A day didn’t go by without getting stuff done, without unexpected things happening and without a lot of improvising. I’d never worked at a startup before, and I really enjoyed the experience. 

As of now I am working on my own projects: I am learning math and computer science, I created a network of diseases proximal to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on shared genes, which I mapped to FDA approved drugs, and I am using text mining and page rank to identify genes that might be associated with ALS and looking for eQTLs in those genes.

I still don’t know what my next scientific adventure will be, but I hope to be able to test the results of my bioinformatics projects in vitro.

Since I was very young, I’ve always had a passion for learning and an insatiable curiosity. Since I learned to read and count, books and math have been my 2 best friends. Books had the power to transport me to unknown lands, away from my problems. They also contained answers to my questions, and the more I read the more I learned.

Math was beautiful. I loved discovering new properties and uses of numbers. I started studying math by myself on Khan Academy, and soon I was almost ready for calculus, even though I was just a 6th grader. 

I started calculus, and I also started math Olympiad training at a local university. It was then when I heard about a math program in Cornell University called AwesomeMath. I really wanted to attend the program, and I told my teachers about it. To my surprise, they were not supportive of my efforts to attend the program; which was the tipping point that led me to drop out of school. School was not satisfying my intellectual curiosity, and I wasn’t getting the support I needed to satisfy it. 

Around the same time, a new school opened in Guatemala. It was called Acton Academy. Acton was a school unlike any other. There weren’t grades, teachers or a set curriculum. I was free to learn what I wanted, I could socialize with peers equally passionate about learning, I got to work on projects and participate in socratic discussions. 

About a year after entering Acton Academy, I was flourishing. I discovered my intellectual curiosity was never satisfied, but I was given a remarkable amount of freedom, which I then used to try to focus on answering the right questions. 

It was at Acton that I was first exposed to biology. I was hooked. Neuroscience was what called my attention the most. How could a set of cells and electrical impulses could determine who we where? How could our brain store knowledge? What happened on different brain disorders, like Alzheimer’s, ALS and Schizophrenia that made the brain stop working properly? I knew I wanted to learn as much as I could about how the brain works, the next step was finding the right problem to work on. 

A mentor of mine was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when I was 11. ALS is a disease in which motor neurons die, leaving patients paralyzed until they die within 3-5 years. Up to that point, I was oblivious about what was going on in his brain; I could just see his body slowly deteriorating. After reading a fair amount of papers, I decided I wanted to work on ALS, and I started working at a lab at UCSF.
 
Working at the lab was a great experience, but there were still several things I did not know about biology that I wasn’t picking up at the bench. For that reason I decided to start taking graduate level courses at UCSF. I finished all the courses for the Tetrad program at UCSF, and I started auditing classes at Stanford. 

Currently I spend most of my time doing research/reading papers, teaching myself math and CS and auditing classes at Stanford. I do not have a high school degree yet but I will get one from Beach High School pretty soon, and I’ll end up graduating 2 years earlier than I would have if I had continued going down a traditional path. 

In conclusion, I changed schools when I was in 6th grade, went to Acton Academy for a year, then was homeschooled and will graduate 2 years earlier with a diploma from Beach High School. 


Have you ever been found responsible for a disciplinary violation at any educational institution you have attended from the 9th grade (or the international equivalent) forward, whether related to academic misconduct or behavioral misconduct, that resulted in a disciplinary action?
